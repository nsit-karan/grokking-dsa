# 2 pointer problems
## List of problems that can be solved using the 2 pointer approach
- Given an array of integers, move all zeros to the end of the array.
- Find any three values in a sorted array that sum up to 999
- find whether string is a palindrome or not
- find whether 2 values in a sorted array sum up to 999
- reverse an array

All of the above are O(n) and can be solved in liner time (generally 1 pass of the array will suffice)
